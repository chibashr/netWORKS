## Overview

NetWORKS uses Qt's signal and slot mechanism to enable event-driven programming. Signals are emitted when certain events occur, and slots (callback functions) are executed in response to these signals.

Signals enable:
- Loose coupling between components
- Event-driven architecture
- Plugin extensibility
- Reactive UI updates

## Core Signals

### Device Manager Signals

```python
# Device-related signals
device_added: Signal(object)         # Emitted when a device is added
device_removed: Signal(object)       # Emitted when a device is removed
device_changed: Signal(object)       # Emitted when a device is changed
selection_changed: Signal(list)      # Emitted when device selection changes

# Group-related signals
group_added: Signal(object)          # Emitted when a group is added
group_removed: Signal(object)        # Emitted when a group is removed
group_changed: Signal(object)        # Emitted when a group is changed
```

Example usage:
```python
def initialize(self):
    # Connect to device signals
    self.device_manager.device_added.connect(self.on_device_added)
    self.device_manager.device_removed.connect(self.on_device_removed)
    self.device_manager.device_changed.connect(self.on_device_changed)
    self.device_manager.selection_changed.connect(self.on_selection_changed)
    
    # Connect to group signals
    self.device_manager.group_added.connect(self.on_group_added)
    self.device_manager.group_removed.connect(self.on_group_removed)
    self.device_manager.group_changed.connect(self.on_group_changed)
    
    return True

def on_device_added(self, device):
    logger.debug(f"Device added: {device.get_property('alias')}")
    
def on_device_removed(self, device):
    logger.debug(f"Device removed: {device.get_property('alias')}")
    
def on_device_changed(self, device):
    logger.debug(f"Device changed: {device.get_property('alias')}")
    
def on_selection_changed(self, devices):
    logger.debug(f"Selection changed: {len(devices)} devices selected")
```

### Device Group Signals

```python
changed: Signal()                    # Emitted when group changes
device_added: Signal(object)         # Emitted when device is added to group
device_removed: Signal(object)       # Emitted when device is removed from group
```

### Plugin Manager Signals

```python
plugin_loaded: Signal(object)        # Emitted when a plugin is loaded
plugin_unloaded: Signal(object)      # Emitted when a plugin is unloaded
plugin_enabled: Signal(object)       # Emitted when a plugin is enabled
plugin_disabled: Signal(object)      # Emitted when a plugin is disabled
```

Example usage:
```python
def initialize(self):
    # Connect to plugin manager signals
    self.plugin_manager.plugin_loaded.connect(self.on_plugin_loaded)
    self.plugin_manager.plugin_unloaded.connect(self.on_plugin_unloaded)
    
    return True

def on_plugin_loaded(self, plugin_info):
    logger.debug(f"Plugin loaded: {plugin_info.name}")
    
    # Check if it's a specific plugin we want to interact with
    if plugin_info.id == "network_scanner":
        # Get the plugin instance
        scanner_plugin = plugin_info.instance
        if scanner_plugin:
            # Connect to its signals
            scanner_plugin.scan_completed.connect(self.on_scan_completed)
            scanner_plugin.scan_device_found.connect(self.on_device_found)
            # Connect to profile management signals
            scanner_plugin.profile_created.connect(self.on_profile_created)
            scanner_plugin.profile_updated.connect(self.on_profile_updated)
            scanner_plugin.profile_deleted.connect(self.on_profile_deleted)
    
def on_plugin_unloaded(self, plugin_info):
    logger.debug(f"Plugin unloaded: {plugin_info.name}")

# Signal handler examples
def on_scan_completed(self, results):
    logger.info(f"Scan completed with {results.get('devices_found', 0)} devices")

def on_device_found(self, device):
    logger.info(f"Found device: {device.get_property('ip_address')}")

def on_profile_created(self, profile_name):
    logger.info(f"Scan profile created: {profile_name}")

def on_profile_updated(self, profile_name):
    logger.info(f"Scan profile updated: {profile_name}")

def on_profile_deleted(self, profile_name):
    logger.info(f"Scan profile deleted: {profile_name}")
```

## UI Signals

### Main Window Signals

```python
initialized: Signal()                # Emitted when main window is initialized
closing: Signal()                    # Emitted when main window is closing
```

### Device Table View Signals

```python
double_clicked: Signal(object)              # Emitted when a device is double-clicked
context_menu_requested: Signal(list, object) # Emitted when context menu is requested
                                            # Arguments: devices, menu
```

Example usage:
```python
def initialize(self):
    # Connect to device table signals
    device_table = self.app.main_window.device_table
    device_table.double_clicked.connect(self.on_device_double_clicked)
    device_table.context_menu_requested.connect(self.on_context_menu_requested)
    
    return True

def on_device_double_clicked(self, device):
    logger.debug(f"Device double-clicked: {device.get_property('alias')}")
    
def on_context_menu_requested(self, devices, menu):
    logger.debug(f"Context menu requested for {len(devices)} devices")
    
    # Add custom menu items
    if devices:
        menu.addAction("My Custom Action", lambda: self.on_custom_action(devices))
```

### Device Tree View Signals

```python
device_double_clicked: Signal(object) # Emitted when a device is double-clicked
```

## Plugin Signals

Plugin interfaces provide several signals:

```python
plugin_initialized: Signal()         # Emitted when plugin is initialized
plugin_starting: Signal()            # Emitted when plugin is starting
plugin_running: Signal()             # Emitted when plugin is running
plugin_stopping: Signal()            # Emitted when plugin is stopping
plugin_cleaned_up: Signal()          # Emitted when plugin is cleaned up
plugin_error: Signal(str)            # Emitted when plugin encounters an error
```

Plugins can also define and emit their own custom signals:

```python
from PySide6.QtCore import QObject, Signal

class MyPlugin(PluginInterface):
    # Define custom signals
    device_scanned = Signal(object, dict)   # Emitted when device scan completes
    scan_started = Signal(object)           # Emitted when scan starts
    
    def scan_device(self, device):
        """Scan a device for information"""
        # Emit signal that scan has started
        self.scan_started.emit(device)
        
        # Perform the scan
        results = self._perform_scan(device)
        
        # Emit signal with results
        self.device_scanned.emit(device, results)
        
        return results
```

Other plugins can connect to these signals:

```python
def initialize(self):
    # Find the plugin we want to connect to
    scanner_plugin_info = self.plugin_manager.get_plugin("scanner_plugin")
    if scanner_plugin_info and scanner_plugin_info.loaded:
        scanner_plugin = scanner_plugin_info.instance
        
        # Connect to its signals
        scanner_plugin.device_scanned.connect(self.on_device_scanned)
        scanner_plugin.scan_started.connect(self.on_scan_started)
    
    return True

def on_device_scanned(self, device, results):
    logger.info(f"Device {device.get_property('alias')} scanned with {len(results)} results")
    
def on_scan_started(self, device):
    logger.info(f"Scan started for device {device.get_property('alias')}")
```

## Working with Signals

### Connecting to Signals

Connect a signal to a slot (callback function):

```python
# Connect to a signal
signal.connect(slot)

# Example
self.device_manager.device_added.connect(self.on_device_added)
```

### Disconnecting from Signals

Always disconnect from signals in the `cleanup` method to prevent memory leaks:

```python
def cleanup(self):
    # Disconnect from signals
    self.device_manager.device_added.disconnect(self.on_device_added)
    self.device_manager.device_removed.disconnect(self.on_device_removed)
    
    return super().cleanup()
```

### Emitting Signals

Emit a signal to notify listeners:

```python
# Emit a signal
self.my_signal.emit(arg1, arg2)

# Example
self.scan_completed.emit(device, results)
```

### Signal Parameters

Signals can have multiple parameters:

```python
# Define a signal with multiple parameters
my_signal = Signal(object, str, int)

# Emit the signal with all parameters
self.my_signal.emit(device, "status", 42)

# Connect to the signal with a matching slot
self.my_signal.connect(self.on_my_signal)

def on_my_signal(self, device, status, code):
    logger.debug(f"Received signal: {device}, {status}, {code}")
```

## Multi-Device Selection Signals

Starting from version 0.5.4, NetWORKS supports multi-device selection. This affects how you handle signals, particularly the `selection_changed` signal:

```python
def on_selection_changed(self, devices):
    """Handle selection change
    
    Args:
        devices: List of selected devices
    """
    # Clear current display
    self.panel.clear()
    
    if not devices:
        # No devices selected
        self.show_empty_state()
        return
        
    if len(devices) == 1:
        # Single device selected
        device = devices[0]
        self.show_single_device_view(device)
    else:
        # Multiple devices selected
        self.show_multi_device_view(devices)
```

### Context Menu with Multiple Selection

The `context_menu_requested` signal now provides a list of selected devices:

```python
def on_context_menu_requested(self, devices, menu):
    """Handle context menu request
    
    Args:
        devices: List of selected devices
        menu: QMenu instance
    """
    if not devices:
        return
        
    # Create action based on selection count
    if len(devices) == 1:
        # Single device action
        device = devices[0]
        action = menu.addAction(f"Scan {device.get_property('alias')}")
        action.triggered.connect(lambda: self.scan_device(device))
    else:
        # Multi-device action
        action = menu.addAction(f"Scan {len(devices)} devices")
        action.triggered.connect(lambda: self.scan_devices(devices))
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Disconnect Signals

Always disconnect signals in the `cleanup` method to prevent memory leaks and unexpected behavior:

```python
def cleanup(self):
    # Disconnect from all signals
    self.device_manager.device_added.disconnect(self.on_device_added)
    
    return super().cleanup()
```

### 2. Type Hints for Signals

Use type hints to document the expected parameters for signals:

```python
from PySide6.QtCore import Signal
from typing import Dict, List

class MyPlugin(PluginInterface):
    # Signal with type hints in comments
    device_scanned = Signal(object, dict)  # (Device, Dict[str, str])
```

### 3. Signal Documentation

Document your signals in your plugin's API.md file:

```markdown
## Signals

### device_scanned

Emitted when a device scan is completed.

**Arguments:**
- `device` (Device): The scanned device
- `results` (dict): Dictionary of scan results

**Example:**
```python
plugin.device_scanned.connect(on_device_scanned)

def on_device_scanned(device, results):
    print(f"Scan completed for {device.get_property('alias')}")
```
```

### 4. Handle Multiple Devices

Always design your signal handlers to work with both single devices and multiple devices:

```python
def on_context_menu_action(self, devices):
    """Handle context menu action for one or more devices"""
    if isinstance(devices, list):
        # Multiple devices
        for device in devices:
            self.process_device(device)
    else:
        # Single device
        self.process_device(devices)
```

### 5. Be Mindful of Performance

Consider performance implications when emitting signals with large data:

```python
def process_large_dataset(self, devices):
    # Process in batches to avoid excessive UI updates
    batch_size = 10
    for i in range(0, len(devices), batch_size):
        batch = devices[i:i+batch_size]
        # Process batch
        results = self._process_batch(batch)
        
        # Emit batch completion signal with summarized data
        self.batch_completed.emit(len(batch), len(results))
```

### 6. Connect to Signals Conditionally

Connect to signals only when needed and check if objects are valid:

```python
def initialize(self):
    # Only connect if the component exists
    if hasattr(self.app.main_window, 'device_table'):
        self.app.main_window.device_table.double_clicked.connect(
            self.on_device_double_clicked
        )
    
    return True
```

        app.main_window.initialized.connect(self.on_main_window_initialized)
    
    return True
```

### Settings Registration

Plugins can register configurable settings:

```python
def get_settings(self):
    """Get plugin settings"""
    return {
        "setting_id": {
            "name": "Human-readable name",
            "description": "Setting description",
            "type": "string|int|float|bool|choice",
            "default": default_value,
            "value": current_value,
            "choices": ["choice1", "choice2"]  # Only for type "choice"
        },
