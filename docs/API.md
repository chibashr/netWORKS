## Application

The `Application` class is the main entry point for the application. Plugins receive a reference to this class in their constructor.

```python
class Application:
    def __init__(self, argv)
    @property device_manager: DeviceManager  # Access to the device manager
    @property plugin_manager: PluginManager  # Access to the plugin manager
    @property config: Config                 # Access to the configuration manager
    @property main_window: MainWindow        # Access to the main window (only available after initialization)
```

## Device Manager

The `DeviceManager` class manages devices and device groups.

```python
class DeviceManager:
    # Signals
    device_added: Signal(object)            # Emitted when a device is added
    device_removed: Signal(object)          # Emitted when a device is removed
    device_changed: Signal(object)          # Emitted when a device is changed
    group_added: Signal(object)             # Emitted when a group is added
    group_removed: Signal(object)           # Emitted when a group is removed
    group_changed: Signal(object)           # Emitted when a group is changed (devices added/removed)
    selection_changed: Signal(list)         # Emitted when device selection changes
    
    # Methods
    def add_device(self, device): Device    # Add a device to the system
    def remove_device(self, device): bool   # Remove a device from the system
    def get_device(self, device_id): Device # Get a device by ID
    def get_devices(): list                 # Get all devices
    def create_group(self, name, description="", parent_group=None): DeviceGroup  # Create a device group
    def remove_group(self, group): bool     # Remove a device group
    def get_group(self, name): DeviceGroup  # Get a group by name
    def get_groups(): list                  # Get all groups
    def add_device_to_group(self, device, group): bool  # Add a device to a group
    def remove_device_from_group(self, device, group): bool  # Remove a device from a group
    def select_device(self, device, exclusive=False): bool  # Select a device
    def deselect_device(self, device): bool  # Deselect a device
    def clear_selection(): bool             # Clear device selection
    def get_selected_devices(): list        # Get selected devices
    def save_devices(): bool                # Save devices to file
    def load_devices(): bool                # Load devices from file
    def refresh_devices(): bool             # Refresh device status
```

# Device Properties

## Core Properties

NetWORKS devices have the following core properties that are managed by the application:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the device
- `alias`: Human-readable name for the device
- `hostname`: Network hostname
- `ip_address`: IP address
- `mac_address`: MAC address
- `status`: Current status (up, down, unknown, etc.)
- `notes`: User notes
- `tags`: List of tags for categorizing devices

Core properties are always displayed at the top of the properties panel.

## Plugin Properties

Plugins should use a naming convention for their properties to ensure they appear in the "Plugin Properties" section:

```python
# Set a plugin property
device.set_property("plugin_id:property_name", "value")

# Examples
device.set_property("scanner:last_scan", "2023-05-15")
device.set_property("monitor.alarm_threshold", 95)
device.set_property("backup_tool_backup_path", "/backups/device1")
```

Plugin properties can use any of these prefixes:
- `plugin_id:property_name` (colon separator)
- `plugin_id.property_name` (dot separator)
- `plugin_id_property_name` (underscore separator)

Where `plugin_id` matches the plugin's ID exactly.

## Custom Properties

Any properties not matching core or plugin naming patterns are considered custom properties and appear in the "Custom Properties" section.

```python
# Set a custom property
device.set_property("location", "Server Room 3")
```
