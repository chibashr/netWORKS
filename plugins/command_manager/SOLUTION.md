# Command Manager Plugin Enhancements

## 1. Comprehensive Credentials Management

The credentials management system has been enhanced to support multiple credential sources:

### Device-Specific Credentials
- Individual credentials for each device
- Stored securely with encryption
- Take highest priority when running commands

### Group-Based Credentials
- Shared credentials for device groups
- Used as fallback when device-specific credentials aren't available
- Simplifies credential management for many devices

### Subnet-Based Credentials
- Credentials for IP subnets (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
- Used as fallback when device-specific and group credentials aren't available
- Automatic matching based on device IP address
- Useful for managing credentials for entire network segments

### Credential Store Implementation
- Created a new `CredentialStore` class that manages all credential types
- Hierarchical credential lookup (device → group → subnet)
- Secure storage with encryption for passwords
- Organized directory structure:
  ```
  data/
    credentials/
      devices/     # Device-specific credentials
      groups/      # Group-based credentials
      subnets/     # Subnet-based credentials
  ```

## 2. Cisco IOS XE Command Set

Created a comprehensive command set for Cisco IOS XE devices:

- File: `data/commands/cisco_iosxe.json`
- Device Type: "Cisco IOS XE"
- Firmware Version: "16.x"
- Contains 30 essential commands for network administrators
- Includes commands for:
  - Basic device information (version, inventory)
  - Configuration management
  - Interface status and statistics
  - Routing protocols (OSPF, BGP)
  - Network protocols (CDP, HSRP, VRRP)
  - System health (CPU, memory, environment)
  - Security (access lists)
  - SD-WAN configuration

This command set provides a solid foundation for managing Cisco IOS XE devices and can be extended as needed.

## 3. Plugin Documentation

Created a detailed API.md file that documents:

- Plugin interface methods
- Command set management API
- Credential management API
- Command execution API
- Output management API
- UI components
- Data model classes
- Integration points with the main application

The documentation follows standard Markdown format and provides clear explanations of all public APIs that the plugin exposes.

## 4. Commands Tab in Device Properties

Added a "Commands" tab to the device properties panel:

- Displays a history of all commands run on the device
- Shows command text, date/time, and success status
- Provides a button to view the full command output
- Includes functionality to delete command outputs
- Allows exporting of command outputs directly from the tab

## 5. Report Generation

Added a comprehensive report generation system:

- Accessible via toolbar button
- Supports multiple output formats:
  - Text (.txt)
  - HTML (.html) with styling
  - Excel (.xlsx) with formatting
  - Word (.docx) with professional layout
- Configurable options:
  - Include device information
  - Include all command outputs or only most recent
  - Date range filtering
  - Success/failure filtering
- Multi-device support for generating batch reports
