# Command Manager Plugin Bugfixes and Enhancements

## 1. Fixed DeviceGroup Check Error

Fixed the error with `'DeviceGroup' object has no attribute 'get_devices'` by enhancing the device group detection logic to handle different possible implementations of device groups:

- Added try/except blocks to gracefully handle errors
- Added checks for different possible methods to retrieve devices from a group:
  - `get_devices()`
  - `devices` property
  - `get_device_ids()`

## 2. Updated UI to Use Row Selection

Replaced checkboxes with row selection in the command dialog:
- Removed checkbox columns from device and command tables
- Updated UI to use multi-row selection
- Modified device and command selection logic to work with row selection
- Improved visual clarity and better aligned with the application's standard UI patterns

## 3. Implemented Comprehensive Credential Manager

Added a full-featured credential manager UI with support for:
- Device-specific credentials
- Group-based credentials
- Subnet-based credentials

Made the credential manager accessible from:
- Main toolbar

## 4. Added Commands Tab to Device Properties

Implemented a Commands tab in the device properties panel that shows:
- Command history for the selected device
- Command text, timestamp, and success status

## 5. Added Report Generation

Implemented a report generation feature that:
- Supports Text, HTML, Excel, and Word formats
