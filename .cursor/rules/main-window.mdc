# Important
When making changes, make sure to use your reason to update [version_manifest.json](mdc:docs/version_manifest.json). Use [versioning.md](mdc:docs/versioning.md) as a reference for this.

When implementing a new feature, update the docs folder. 

# Also Remember
The main window should be able to run without plugins fully. The main window should be completely accessible for plugins, and should just act as a scaffolding for plugins. It is for these reasons that the main window needs to be fully documented.

The plugins folder is only where plugins live, and should not be modified as the main window, only in reference the plugin.

Update [requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt) when adding new requirements.

PySide6 is used for the UI for this program.
